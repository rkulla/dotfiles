*This is a custom fold
- Type a dash to start a bullet point, which only shows as`-`only while editing a line, otherwise shows as â€¢
-`Text inside of single backticks will appear red with a gray background`(isn't that nice?)
-`HyperLinks are dimmed to be less distracting:`https://google.com (load with <leader>o)
  - nested bullet
- Local file link: foo.txt (load with gf. ^f to auto-complete local files)
- Local images work too: test-highlights-ex-image.png (load with gx)
-*blah*
- Foo*highlighter word in asterisks*
Example command:"foo"
    $ echo "Running command with one dollar"  # but don't highlight this comment!
SELECT * FROM blah; -- Shouldn't highlight because we don't look at space directly after the *
select*from blah;* -- SHOULD highlight since that's ok
[] Todo lists items will be highlighted as black brackets and bold lines.`inline backticks`still work
_Underscored Text_ does nothing because it's not always contained like in foo_bar
Here's a triple backticked block:
```
    if [ -f "$HOME/foo.zsh" ]; then
      source "$HOME/foo.zsh"
    fi
```
But triplebackticks also work inline even with multiple lines if i don't want surrounding blank lines:
```if [ -f "$HOME/foo.zsh" ]; then
      source "$HOME/foo.zsh"
    fi```
Backticks are editable but simply match the bg color to appear invisible unless my cursor is on the line.
Also does very basic highlighting of code. Fortunately normal code highlighting outside of .txt will work:
    console.log(var[0]);
    x := {
       "foo": ["bar"],
       "baz": "quux"
    }
